- /controllesrs
stores controller files which handle the logic of diffrent routes of the API
- /models

- /routes 
stores routes definition for API 
- /middleware 
stores custom middleware functions 
- /services 
stores buisness logic and service functions (functions related to user operations)
- /utils 
stores utility functions and helpers like loger, email format validation, hashing function etc. 
- /databse 
stores files with databse classes and functions neccesary to manage databse(should be created as dependencie for easy and flexible changeof  databse)

### My Definition of Controller, Service, Middleware used in code managment 
Controller vs Sevice vs Middleware
Controller is supposed to handle logic of managing requests and responses where Sevice is supposed to handle buisnes logic of API endpoint(the action which user wants to achive). Middleware on toher hand is similar to Controller however its supposed to be a more of a help function not performing tha main logic of given Route

# API endpoints

### 1. /login
Logs in user based on given credentials. If User is registerd response will be succesfull and will return authorization token for login session. This token should be later used for user authentication.<br>
If user has provided "Atuhorization" header will return that User has authenticated himself with token. 
If login action is not succesfull then variable "success" is false, otherwise true. "auth" is variable holding authorization token for user next API calls in order to identify him. If during API call there will be an error varaible "error" will be added with value true. 
``` json
request{
    email : {type: string, required : true}, 
    password : {type: string, required : true}
}

response{
    success : {type: bool}, 
    message : {type : string}, 
    auth : {type :string}
    error : {type : bool, optional : true }
}
```
### 2. /register
``` json
request: {
    email : {type: string, required : true}, 
    password : {type: string, required : true},
    username : {type: string, required : true}, 
    firstname: {type: String},
    lastname: {type: String},
    discrod: {type: String},
}
response: {
    success : {type: boolean}, 
    duplicate : {type: boolean}, 
    message : {type : string}
}
```
